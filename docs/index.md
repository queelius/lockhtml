# pagevault

**Password-protect semi-private content on static sites** – no backend required.

Encrypt sensitive pages and sections while keeping navigation, styling, and public content unchanged. Works with Hugo, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting.

## The Problem

You want to publish semi-private content on your static site:
- Technical docs with client-confidential sections
- Blog posts mixing public narratives with private thoughts
- Educational material with solutions behind passwords
- Shared notes that shouldn't be fully public (yet)

Traditional solutions require a backend. pagevault works with *pure static hosting* – your site lives entirely on GitHub Pages, no server needed.

## How It Works

Mark sections with `<pagevault>` tags. pagevault encrypts just those sections while preserving your site's structure, styling, navigation, and scripts.

```html
<header>Public navigation</header>

<pagevault hint="Contact me for the password">
  <h2>Private thoughts on this topic</h2>
  <p>This section is encrypted...</p>
</pagevault>

<footer>Public footer</footer>
```

Visitors see your site normally. When they encounter protected content, a password prompt appears. Once unlocked, the content displays beautifully—and the password can be remembered in the browser (you control this).

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install pagevault
```

### 2. Mark content

```html
<pagevault hint="Contact admin for password">
  Private content here
</pagevault>
```

### 3. Create config

```bash
pagevault config init
```

### 4. Encrypt and deploy

```bash
pagevault lock index.html
# Deploy _locked/index.html to your static host
```

That's it! Visitors see a password prompt on protected sections.
